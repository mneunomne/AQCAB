We are sitting dressed up, sleep-deprived, waiting for a check from the District Administration - today 7B has an open history lesson. \\\n   \"Who knows what the main geopolitical advantage of Belarus is?\" the teacher asks. - asks the teacher.\\\n   \"We are located on the transit territory between the West and the East\" - we answer almost in unison with memorized words. \\\n   When you hear and repeat something as often as the phrase about \"transit territory\", the meaning is gradually erased, sharpened like a sea pebble, leaving you with a smooth, literally \"polished\" fact.\\\n   \\\n   After the open history lesson a lot of things happened: 7B gradually turned into 11 (just 11, two classes merged and we were left without a letter); I downloaded an 8GB archive of yaoi manga; I jokingly started dating my friend - the joke became serious, I got scared and \"merged\"; I fell in love with my friend's boyfriend and he broke my heart; I won the social studies Olympiad and decided to enter the philosophy department. \\\n   \\\n   In the midst of the teenage fuss of falling in love, enrollment, moving to the dormitory from home and home from the dormitory, few things remained as immutable as the fact that \"Belarus is located on the transit territory between the West and the East. At that time I did not comprehend this fact in any way, it seemed to me as neutral as the multiplication table: an obvious answer to an obvious question. \\\n   \\\n   Then there was a different kind of hustle and bustle: parties, drugs, new acquaintances, a lot of sex and little sleep, somehow miraculously passed exams and a constant search for an answer to the question: \"What am I in general?\\\n   \\\n   In any case, things are not so pessimistic: \"uncertainty\" always comes paired with \"temporary\" - we don't know what we are yet, but we are bound to find an answer, many answers, many different ones. For myself, I decided that I don't need a label so much: I think identity is always a process, a rhizome growing right here and now. Especially Belarusian queer identity - we don't even have our own words to describe it. So we invent those words in real time, telling our stories to the world and, more importantly, to ourselves.",
